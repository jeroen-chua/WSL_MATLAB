Freeman Pyramid MEX Interface
-----------------------------

June 2001, Thomas F.El-Maraghi

The source code in this directory builds a MEX interface
to the Freeman pyramid C code.  

You will need to do the following:

1. Compile the code for your system.

	- select the Makefile that applies to you (e.g.,
          Makefile.matlab53.solaris for Matlab 5.3 and
	  the Solaris operating system).

	- at the top of the make file, change the macro
	  MATLAB to point to the directory where Matlab
          is installed on your sytem.

        - compile the code (e.g., make -f Makefile.matlab53.solaris)

2. Add this directory to your Matlab path.

3. Type help freemanPyramid at the Matlab prompt for
   information on how to use the MEX function (or view
   freemanPyramid.m directly).
